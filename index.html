            <p class="sec-subtag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits
                and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework,
                such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach
                but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning
                through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early
                childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education..</p>

            <p class="sec-subtag text-small">Education serves various roles in society, spanning social, economic, and
                personal domains. Socially, education establishes and maintains a stable society by imparting
                fundamental skills necessary for interacting with the environment and fulfilling individual needs and
                aspirations. In contemporary society, these skills encompass speaking, reading, writing, arithmetic, and
                proficiency in information and communications technology. Additionally, education facilitates
                socialization by instilling awareness of dominant social and cultural norms, shaping appropriate
                behavior across diverse contexts. It fosters social cohesion, stability, and peace, fostering productive
                engagement in daily activities. While socialization occurs throughout life, early childhood education
                holds particular significance. Moreover, education plays a pivotal role in democracies by enhancing
                civic participation through voting and organizing, while also promoting equal opportunities for all.</p>

            <p class="sec-subtag text-small">Educational success, also referred to as student and academic achievement,
                pertains to the extent to which educational objectives are met, such as the acquisition of knowledge and
                skills by students. For practical purposes, it is often primarily measured in terms of official exam
                scores, but numerous additional indicators exist, including attendance rates, graduation rates, dropout
                rates, student attitudes, and post-school indicators such as later income and incarceration rates.[100]
                Several factors influence educational achievement, such as psychological factors related to the
                individual student, and sociological factors associated with the student's social environment.
                Additional factors encompass access to educational technology, teacher quality, and parental
                involvement. Many of these factors overlap and mutually influence each othe.</p>
